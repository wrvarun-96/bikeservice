These are the basic question intrested to solve:- 
1)When do they ride?
2)How far do they go? 
3)Which stations are most popular?
4)What days of the week are most rides taken on?

Here problem faced while eda is that many start or end station were not having station numbers.Next is that we had to find geolocations for stations as it may be helpful for predictions.Random forest gave best result in this.
